## Set up Emacs for org-protocol, org-roam-graph, and org-roam-server

You will need to modify [Windows registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#Registry_editors), and some Elisp coding. These are not difficult to do, but proceed at your own risk, especially with Windows Registry; I just do this without fully understanding what I am doing. 

1. Install Graphviz on Windows, and try `org-roam-graph`
2. Set up your Windows Registry for `emacsclientw` (Emacs Server -- you can see in-system manual Emacs > Emacs Server)
3. Set up and patch Emacs for `org-protocol` and `org-roam-protocol`
  I have got both Firefox and Chrome working. I will show you both. They require different levels of "patching" with using Elisp coding. Firefox is straightforward, and thus I would recommend it. Chrome is a little more challenging, but it certainly works. 

### Before we begin

Add this in your config.
I have put it at the top of `.emacs`, even before the "Packages" section.

You should be fine without it. Without it, `org-roam-graph` asks encoding -- in my case, with a default of a Chinese variant. By specifying the "language environment" (whatever this means), it will not ask the encoding. I think it makes sense to set it to "UTF-8" in the modern, Unicode world. 

```
;; UTF-8 as default encoding
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
```

### Install Graphviz on Windows, and try `org-roam-graph`

Go to Graphviz [download site](https://graphviz.org/download/).

![](./images/2020-07-15_22-19-56.png)

For Chrome, you might get these "error" messages -- I just took the risk and kept the file. Decide whether or not it's worth moving forward.

Unzip the archive. You get folders and files like this.

![](./images/2020-07-15_22-29-09.png)

Please the whole folder in your `~/bin/` folder in the same way as other software we have seen in previous chapters (that is, no "installer", and unzip and place). 

Put the following in your Emacs config file (if you have been following this guide from earlier chapters, it is `~/.emacs`).

```
(setq org-roam-graph-executable "~/bin/graphviz-2.44.1-win32/Graphviz/bin/dot.exe")
```
    
Evaluate it -- you can use `eval-buffer`, or more specific ones such as `eval-region` or `eval-last-sexp`.

Now you should be able to display a graph of your notes in `org-roam-directory` within your Emacs by calling `M-x org-roam-graph`. 

![](./images/2020-07-16_18-18-06.png)

The reason why `org-roam-graph` does not call a browser is because this behaviour is controlled by variable `org-roam-graph-viewer` -- it should be `nil` if you are on Windows by default[^1]. 

If you see a graph displayed, then Graphviz is working for your Emacs. Let's move on to the next part of the configuration.

[^1]: There is a little more to it behind the scenes. It is indeed Firefox, but because the default path is not recognised on Windows, and then it is set to `nil`. You can see what is "really" happening if you inspect the source code of of `org-roam-graph.el`; look at the `defcustom` for `org-roam-graph-viewer`. You can do so via `M-h v RET  org-roam-graph-viewer` to view the definition and its current value, and then jump to `org-roam-graph.el`.

### Display the graph in a browser

Getting `org-roam-graph` to launch and display the graph in Chrome is easy. Set variable `org-roam-graph-viewer` to the path the path to `chrome.exe`.

With my PC, it is this path below. You can adjust the path for your PC, evaluate the following, and call `org-roam-graph` to see it in action.

```
;; in your Emacs config file

(setq org-roam-graph-viewer "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe")
```

![Chrome displaying the graph](./images/2020-07-18_12-37-28.png)


If you want to use Firefox, this is not enough. You will notice that Emacs launches, but the graph is not directly opened -- in my case, Firefox opens my default search engine with the file path to the graph is put into the search box.

Set `org-roam-graph-viewer` to the following value, instead of the path to`firefox.exe`.

```
;; in your Emacs config file

(setq org-roam-graph-viewer '(lambda (file) (let ((file-file (concat "file://" file)))
    (call-process "C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe" nil 0 nil file-file))))
```

Adjust it with the path to `firefox.exe` in your PC. 

What it does is simple. The variable accepts a function. So an anonymous function is set to the variable. The function simply adds "file://" to the front of the file path, and then calls `firefox.exe` with passing the edited path to it.

Now you can display the graph in your browser. Great!

But you will soon notice that clicking on the box does not do anything?! For this, you need to enable Emacs Server, `org-protocol`, and `org-roam-protocol`.  Following sections explain how to do that.

### Emacs Server

Emacs Server lets Emacs run as a server in the background, waiting for an external program to interact with it -- in this case, the external program is your browser. 

This is easy to do. Try the following.

1. In Emacs, `M-x server-start` (if this is your first time, it will create a folder named "server" in your `.emacs.d`, and a file named "server" in the "server" folder)
2. In PowerShell, call the following command. Adjust the path to `emacsclientw.exe` for your PC.

![](./images/2020-07-15_23-26-19.png)

Your Emacs should respond by opening a file named `test.txt` as you can see:

![](./images/2020-07-15_23-26-48.png)

You can use `C-x #` to close this buffer.

If you see this error, there are two possible ways to fix it.

![](./images/2020-07-16_19-09-13.png)

1. Emacs Server is not started. Make sure to call `M-x server-start`
2. Perhaps this is not your first time to run it, and your `server` file is confused. Delete the whole `server` folder within your `.emacs.d`, and then start Emacs Server again.

So... what have we done? You have started Emacs as a server, and learned that Emacs Server can be accessed via `emacsclientw.exe` on Windows. You have also seen that it can take a parameter (argument) as the name of the file to open. 

This is great... But how can we make our browser interact with Emacs Server? We will use the HTML hyperlink for this. 

Then how can a hyperlink do something very specific to Org-roam (or Org Mode)? 

This is where `org-protocol` and `org-roam-protocol` come in. They specify "interfaces" for external programs (such as browsers, PowerShell, etc.) to send specific commands to Emacs Server to do more than just to open a file[^2].

[^2]: Try something like this below in PowerShell -- the file name is an existing note's filename in the `org-roam-directory`; you should see an empty file open, instead of your note. Without `org-protocol` properly set up, Emacs does not understand this argument correctly.

```
# PowerShell

~\bin\emacs-26.3-x86_64\bin\emacsclientw.exe "org-protocol://roam-file?file=c:/Users/nobiot/org-roam/20200711125208-bibtex_completion.org"
```

### `org-protocol` and `org-roam-protocol`

Let's continue, and see what these "protocols" can do for us. 

Put these two lines below in your configuration file, and evaluate. Alternatively, you can use `M-x load-library RET org-protocol` and the same command for `org-roam-protocol`. 

```
(require 'org-protocol)
(require 'org-roam-protocol)
```

If you call the following (adjusting the path to your `emacsclientw.exe` and your note), your Emacs should now display the note correctly. 

```
# PowerShell

~\bin\emacs-26.3-x86_64\bin\emacsclientw.exe "org-protocol://roam-file?file=c:/Users/nobiot/org-roam/20200711125208-bibtex_completion.org"
```

Now we know that `org-protocol`, and its adaptation by Org-roam, `org-roam-protocol` work from Power Shell. Why does it not work from our browser?

To understand this, you can inspect the URL attached to one of the boxes in the graph in your browser. It should look like this (from Chrome).

```
org-protocol://roam-file?file=c%3A%2FUsers%2Fnobiot%2Forg-roam%2F20200711125208-bibtex_completion.org
```

Your browser (or your Windows) does not know how to respond to `org-protocol://` -- its a "protocol", just like `http://` or `https://` that your browser and Windows know by default how to treat[^2].

[^2]: To be a bit more precise,[Wikipedia page on URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) tells me that the protocol part in a URL is "https" not "https://". For our purpose, though, I think this distinction is not relevant.

  > A typical URL could have the form http://www.example.com/index.html, which indicates a protocol (http), a hostname (www.example.com), and a file name (index.html).

### Set up your Windows Registry for `emacsclientw`

For your browser and Windows recognise URL with `org-protocol://`, you need to edit Windows registry to define a custom "protocol for URL".

You do not need to understand what exactly [Windows registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry#Registry_editors) is. I admit I do not have full understanding of it. For our purpose, it is enough to understand that it can be used to defines a custom "protocol for URL" for the browser. 

Just one word of caution, however, before we proceed. Windows registry is very technically "low-level", meaning close to the fundamental part of Windows. [You could mess up your Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/Library-Reference/Concepts/security-notes-for-microsoft-office-solution-developers#modifying-the-windows-registry) (also [this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/256986/windows-registry-information-for-advanced-users)), if you touch anything else. It might also open up some security issue. I cannot fully assets the security risk posed by `org-protocol` in the context of Windows registry -- I assume it will be low, because the parameter you pass to `emacsclientw.exe` is treated as a text string unless you explicitly tell Emacs to do differently -- as with `org-protocol` and `org-roam-protocol`. Proceed at your own risk, please.

Now the warning is out of the way, let's focus on how we can configure it for our purposes. you can follow any of the three documents listed below -- the latter two seem to refer to the first one anyway[^3]. The explanation there might be a bit be too terse. I'll break it down more below. 

[^3]: Do not try the JavaScript bookmarklet for `org-protocol-store-link` in Org-mode's manual -- it does not work for me; my conclusion is that it is obsolete if you have Org Mode 9.3.6 from MELPA, or 9.4 that Doom Emacs get for you. See an additional section later if you wish to see the JavaScript I have done to make the bookmarklet work, if you are interested.

- [Org mode's manual on `org-protocol`](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#org124a1fc)
- [Org-roam's manual on `org-roam-protocol`](https://www.orgroam.com/manual/Installation-_00281_0029.html)[^4]
- [Sacha Chua's post on `org-protocol` from 2015 ](https://sachachua.com/blog/2015/11/capturing-links-quickly-with-emacsclient-org-protocol-and-chrome-shortcut-manager-on-microsoft-windows-8/)

[^4]: Now it's great that Org-roam's official manual contains the information for Windows. This is thanks to the contribution of GitHub user karamme via https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/882. Really cool; thank you.

Follow the steps below.

1. Open a text editor (e.g. Notepad, Emacs). Create a new file, paste the following in, and save as "org-protocol.reg". The name does not matter, but the extension must be `.reg`.

```
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol]
@="URL:Org Protocol"
"URL Protocol"=""
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open]
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open\command]
@="\"C:\\Programme\\Emacs\\emacs\\bin\\emacsclientw.exe\" \"%1\""
```

2. In the text editor, adjust the path for your Windows.

Adjust the following part for your system. It is important to keep the double back slashes. Also note the trailing back slash.

```
"C:\\Programme\\Emacs\\emacs\\bin\\emacsclientw.exe\" 
```

Breathe, take a leap of faith, and double-click on the icon.
![](./images/2020-07-15_23-06-41.png)

There is a one or two messages to really, really make sure that you know what you are doing. Say yes them all.
![](./images/2020-07-15_23-11-24.png)

Once you get through them all, you can view and manually edit what you have done with Registry Editor, which should come with Windows by default. You can delete what you have added via the `.reg` file -- try not to touch anything else. 

![](./images/2020-07-15_23-12-31.png)

You should see `org-protocol` added in the registry like so:

![](./images/2020-07-15_23-14-47.png)

You can edit the path if you double-click on the `ab(Default)` part. Notice that the double back slashes are changed to the normal single back slash to specify a path.

![](./images/2020-07-15_23-17-35.png)

Once that's done, you should be able to see your browser behaves differently from before your editing Windows registry.

If you are using Firefox, you should see a dialogue box like this. Choose the path to `emacsclientw.exe`; if you tick the checkbox "Remember my choice for org-roam protocol links", you don't see it again. You can change this via Options. With Firefox, you should be good to go!

![Firefox: clicking the box in graph](./images/2020-07-18_13-46-15.png)

If you are using Chrome, you will get this dialogue box. I don't know how to make the selection default on Chrome yet -- you will get it every time. 

![Chrome: clicking the box in graph](./images/2020-07-18_13-50-35.png)

If you are using Doom, you should be good to go; it gets you the cutting-edge Org Mode version 9.4, which does not have the problem I will be describing here. If you are using Org Mode from MELPA, etc., you would be on 9.3.6 or 9.3.7 (`M-x org-version` to see it), and you likely end up opening an empty note. No worries, there is a fix. Move on to the next section, though it will be a bit technical.

### [Chrome only] Patch Org Mode for `org-protocol` and `org-roam-protocol`

The reason why clicking on a box in Chrome does opens an empty buffer is caused by a function `org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol`. This is part of Org Mode, not Org-roam. If you know how to upgrade your Org Mode to 9.4, which is not released yet, go ahead. That should do the trick. For the rest of us, my humble suggestion is as follows.

The suggestion is to **override** `org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol` (and only this function) with the one that comes with version 9.4.

1. Get the [source code of the function](https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/src/master/lisp/org-protocol.el). I have extracted just the function we want, and put a copy in [this repo](./+org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol.el) 
2. Place it somewhere in your PC; I would suggest somewhere under `.emacs.d`
3. Put the following in your config file (adjust the file path to the `.el` file), so that Emacs loads your function from version Org Mode 9.4, and override the current version (9.3.x) with `advice-add`.

```
(load-file "~/.emacs.d/+org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol.el")
(advice-add 'org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol :override '+org-protocol-check-filename-for-protocol)
```

### `org-roam-server` for more powerful graph functions

[`org-roam-server`](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server) is part of Org-roam ecosystem, and lets you visualize and interact with the graph of your notes. Good news is that its really plug-and-play on top of Org-roam once all the above is working.

1. Install it via `M-x package-install RET org-roam-server`
2. Add the following to your config file. It's a simple translation of `use-package` syntax described in its [documentation](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-server#installation)
3. Enable it by calling `M-x org-roam-server-mode`

That's it!

You can play with the interactive graph visualization of your own notes in your browser. Visit localhost:8080 (or equivalently, 127.0.0.1:8080). 


```
(require 'org-roam-server)
(setq org-roam-server-host "127.0.0.1"
       org-roam-server-port 8080
       org-roam-server-export-inline-images t
       org-roam-server-authenticate nil
       org-roam-server-network-poll t
       org-roam-server-network-arrows nil
       org-roam-server-network-label-truncate t
       org-roam-server-network-label-truncate-length 60
       org-roam-server-network-label-wrap-length 20)
```

Clicking a bubble should take you to the corresponding note in Emacs via `org-roam-protocol`.

### JavaScript for Bookmarklet

The documents referenced above contain sample JavaScript code to be used in a bookmarklet for `org-protocol-store-link`. You need to update it for the current Org Mode (tested on 9.3.6 from MELPA, and 9.4 that Doom Emacs installs).

The obsolete code is this:

```
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link://'+encodeURIComponent(location.href)
```

The correct one that I learned from the source code and tested to work is as follows. Note the "?url=" part.

```
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)
```
