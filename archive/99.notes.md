# Notes


## Comparing look & feel of Emacs and Zettlr

I have to admit, for this tutorial, I have not found a good way to drag & drop images in Emacs, and also adjust the display size of images. Zettlr has a very good support for both of these. 

## Abbrev
`M-h i > Emacs > Abbrevs`
To navigate `>` you can press `m` and type.

`~/.emacs.d/abbrev_def` file is automaticlaly created.

 
### Note -- what is ORB

source: <https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/creating-html-document-notes-with-org-roam-bibtex/396/2?u=nobiot>

> org-note-actions is not for creating notes, but for running helm/ivy-like actions on the note.
>
> ORB patches the Open notes action in org-ref and the Edit notes in helm-/ivy-bibtex, which are the commands you’re supposed to use to create your notes. ORB is mostly about helping you create your bibliographic notes by providing access to BibTeX fields during the template-expansion. Check our manual for details
>
> I know that we’re doing a bad job at explaining what ORB is doing, but this is something that I’m hoping to address soon with #830


### Org Sparstar mode
Slow in Windows with vanilla, but no problem with Doom.
Here is the config from Doom.

(use-package! org-superstar ; "prettier" bullets
  :hook (org-mode . org-superstar-mode)
  :config
  ;; Make leading stars truly invisible, by rendering them as spaces!
  (setq org-superstar-leading-bullet ?\s
        org-superstar-leading-fallback ?\s
        org-hide-leading-stars nil)
  ;; Don't do anything special for item bullets or TODOs by default; these slow
  ;; down larger org buffers.
  (setq org-superstar-prettify-item-bullets nil
        org-superstar-special-todo-items nil
        ;; ...but configure it in case the user wants it later
        org-superstar-todo-bullet-alist
        '(("TODO" . 9744)
          ("[ ]"  . 9744)
          ("DONE" . 9745)
          ("[X]"  . 9745))))

### Ivy
For example, Swiper is a enhanced search capability compared to the default I-Search. I think both have their own spaces, so I don't replace the default one with Swiper.

You can also see that `C-x b` to switch buffer now looks for the files you have recently visited – even after launching Emacs, `.emacs` appears as one of the canditates to swithc to.

### Toggle Tool Bar
One last thing. In the same as Menu Bar mode, you can toggle the Tool Bar – the one with big icons just below the Menu Bar.

## Theme

## Autoinstall init.el

Something like this might be useful.
```
;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; You may delete these explanatory comments.
(package-initialize)

(require 'package)
