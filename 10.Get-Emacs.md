# Get Emacs for Windows

There are many ways to get Emacs for Windows. If you google that, you are likely end up somewhere on [GNU Emacs official website](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html). Let's follow this way.

Go "nearby GNU mirror" under Windows section, and then click on the latest version (as at the time of this writing, it is emacs-27 [^1]).

[^1]: I recommend getting the latest version. Org-roam requires a fairly recent version of Org mode (9.4 or onward). The Emacs version that includes a compatible version of Org (9.4.4) is Emacs 27.2. If there is no reason, avoid Emacs 27.1, which contains Org 9.3, not compatible with Org-roam's requirement.

## Get right Emacs installer executable (or zip file)

I will assume you have the 64-bit version of Windows. If you are not sure, see [section Check if your Windows is 64-bit or 32-bit version](#Check if your Windows is 64-bit or 32-bit version) to learn how to tell if your Windows is the 32-bit or 64-bit version. 

For the 64-bit version, get a installer executable file named `emacs-27.2-x86_64-installer.exe`. This includes software that Emacs uses to show JPEG and other image files, and so on [^2]. 

[^2]: It might be surprising to learn that you need different software to work with images, especially when you have ever used Microsoft Word and other word processing applications. This is fairly common with Emacs, and more broadly with Linux computing traditions.

You can learn more about differences among the files that you can download by reading `README-windows-binaries`. No file extension and you don't know which app to use to open it? Use your text editor. I'm using Visual Studio Code here; it can be Atom, Notepad, etcâ€¦

See it's the Emacs version you have downloaded. 27.2 in my example

## Confirm uninstall.exe

Just as important as installing Emacs, the process creates a way to uninstall it.

Open the location where you have just installed Emacs (in our case, it's `C:\Program Files\Emacs`). Running `Uninstall.exe` let's you remove Emacs from your PC.

This is it. Now you have Emacs installed in your PC. Next section, we will look at how to use Emacs to edit some text. 

## Check if your Windows is 64-bit or 32-bit version 

You can see if your Windows is 64-bit or 32-bit version in Control Panel > System Security > System.
