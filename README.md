# Zero to Emacs and Org-roam: a step-by-step guide on Windows 10

Part 1

1. [Get Emacs for Windows](./10.Get-Emacs.md)
2. [Use Emacs to write some text (including copy & paste)](./20.Use-Emacs.md)
3. [Set up Org-roam (including sqlite3)](./30.Set-up-Org-roam.md)
4. [Improve quality-of-life with your font, theme, and minimal select packages ](./40.Qol.md)

The config file at the end of Part 1 is [located in this repo](./.emacs), too.

6. [Set up Org-ref and Org-roam-bibtex (ORB)](./60.Org-ref_ORB.md)
7. [Export to MS Word](./70.publish.md) -- it's not really proof-read for spelling etc. yet; part of next chapter
8. Get a spell checker for Emacs
9. How to swap CapsLock with Ctrl
10. (maybe) Set up the graph function within Org-roam
11. (maybe) Export to PDF
