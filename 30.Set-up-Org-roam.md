## Set up Org-roam

### Install SQLite
Org-roam relies on database software called SQLite. macOS comes with it, and Linux users would not have a problem installing it. For Windows, you need to manually download it and place it in your PC, in the same way as Emacs.

Go to this official downloading site.
https://sqlite.org/download.html

Download the biggest "bundle of command-line tools" named `sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3320200.zip`. 

The location you put the zip file does not matter. I choose the `bin` folder, the same one as I put Emacs. Extract the zip file to get these executables. What is required for Org-roam is `sqlite3.exe`.

You have two options to let Emacs know where you put it.

1. [Set environmental variable](https://www.opentechguides.com/how-to/article/windows-10/113/windows-10-set-path.html) (you will probably need to log off and log on to get your Windows to use it)
2. [Set a variable within Emacs](https://org-roam.github.io/org-roam/manual/Post_002dInstallation-Tasks)

Org-roam manual mentions the latter, so I'll follow it. This is done in your configuration file (described after installing Org-roam).

### Install Org-roam

```
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```



### Configure Emacs for Org-roam
```
;; Org and Org-roam
(add-to-list 'exec-path "~/bin/sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3320200")
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'org-roam-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n r") #'org-roam)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n i") #'org-roam-insert)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n /") #'org-roam-find-file)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n b") #'org-roam-switch-to-buffer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n d") #'org-roam-find-directory)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo) ;Emacs default is bound to hide Emacs.

```
