# Part 2

In Part 2, I will explore a new territory. I will be also learning along the way with you.

I do not use Org-ref, nor Org-ref-bibtex. For my own notes, I use markdown files, and my own plug-in for Org-roam to support them ([Md-roam](https://github.com/nobiot/md-roam)). For bibliographic notes, instead of Org-ref, I just use `helm-bibtex` with customization for Pandoc Markdown format. 

Having said this, I am making sure that I am building this guide as accurately as possible, while I configure and use the features I describe here. 

You can judge the validity and usefulness of my guide from the outcome. All is open here in GitHub, so you can check what I am writing is correct or not. I will appreciate your feedback or correction.


![I am writing this guide using the very configuration](images/2020-06-23_23-00-07.png)

To improve wirting environment, I have made some changes to my Emacs as below. This has made my Emacs better for writing in Markdown files and looks a bit nicer (my subjective judgement):

1. I have installed `markdown-mode` in order to help me write this very guide I am writng with this set up.

2. I have made some changes to configuration in [`.emacs-part2`](./.emacs-part2) and explanation of some select changes

3. Updated packages. See the section below.


## Changes to Configuration

### Line spacing

```
;;; Line spacing, can be 0 for code and 1 or 2 for text
(setq-default line-spacing 2)
```

The spacing is measured in pixels[^1]. 

[^1]: Refer to the in-system manual via `C-h v line-spacing RET` -- this is a great way to discover things to help you personalise Emacs. 

### Fixed-pitch fonts

The font section of my .emacs now looks like this.

```
;; Font
;;; If you want to know how to correct specify a font in Windows,
;;; invoke `eval-last-sexp' for (w32-select-font
(set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "iA Writer Quattro S-13")
(set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "iA Writer Mono S-12")
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "iA Writer Mono S-12")
(set-fontset-font nil 'symbol (font-spec :family "Segoe UI Symbol" :size 11.0))
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'variable-pitch-mode)
```

This way, when you are in Markdown or Org mode, you will get variable-pitch font, and fixed-pitch font when you are in programming mode or Helm buffer (e.g. to select a bibliographic entry to cite).

### A bit more.
Refer to the [`.emacs-part2`](./.emacs-part2)
