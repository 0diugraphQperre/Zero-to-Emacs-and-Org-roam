## How to insert image from clipboard

Inserting an image easily into my Markdown or Org files was one of the last pieces of puzzle in my Emacs document generation workflow. 

I am certain there are many solutions to this problem; however, I have not been able to work [`org-download`](https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download) and similar Org Mode tools. I think Doom comes with it already configured out of the box. I am sure it works a magic on Linux and perhaps macOS, but I could not get it to work on my Windows set up.


### Functions

Here is my Windows solution below. It does not do drag & drop, unfortunately. I have taken the original solution *somewhere* from Stack Exchange, I believe. I have had it long time, and lost the link to the original since (apologies for not taking enough care about attributions; I have become better since then). 

Please try not to be overwhelmed by the amount of lines. In the end, it is rather simple. It consists of the following parts:

1. Definition of variable
   It defines the folder where the image file should be saved. The default I have is a folder named "images" relative to the current file you are working on.

2. Main function copy the image in your Windows' clipboard, name it, and save it as a PNG image file in the folder defined above

3. An interactive command to insert a image link in the Org Mode syntax

4. An interactive command to insert a image link in the Markdown syntax

That's it. You would either use 3. or 4. 

It delegates the work to PowerShell to deal with Windows' clipboard, and saving it. So (I think) this solution only works on Windows (I realize PowerShell is available cross-platform, but I haven't tested other OSs if it works; I won't). 

It is important to note that the current code *assumes* that you have an image in the clipboard before calling one of the commands. This means that you clip an image first with some other tool. In my case, I have Snagit (commercial software) so I use it. You can use Snipping Tool; or the "Print Screen" button should work (though I have not tested it). 

Having mentioned this assumption, you can get this code to call Snipping Tool, so that you can select a region of your screen to capture it into your clipboard. 

I will talk a bit more about this, and how you can further "customize" this solution in the next section.


```emacs-lisp
;; Adding images
(defvar my/screenshot-directory "./images/")

(defun my/take-screenshot ()
  "This works only in Windows. Call a clipping tool and take a screenshot.
   Store in png format into 'my/screenshot-directory"
  (let ((filename))
    (setq filename (concat my/screenshot-directory
                           (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S")
                           ".png"))
    ;;(shell-command "snippingtool /clip") <<< Uncomment this line if you wish to use Snipping Tool
    (shell-command-to-string
     (format
      "powershell powershell
\"Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms;
if ($([System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard]::ContainsImage()))
 {$image = [System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard]::GetImage();
[System.Drawing.Bitmap]
$image.Save('%s',[System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat]::Png);
 Write-Output 'clipboard content saved as file'
} else {Write-Output 'clipboard does not contain image data'}\"" filename))
    filename))

(defun my/org-screenshot ()
  "Take a screenshot into a time stamped unique-named file in the
same directory as the org-buffer and insert a link to this file."
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (my/take-screenshot)))
    (insert (concat "[[file:" filename "]]"))))

(defun my/md-screenshot ()
  "Take a screenshot into my/screenshot-directory
Insert a markdown image link"
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (my/take-screenshot)))
    (insert (concat "![]("filename")"))))
```

### Further configuration

You can change some bits and pieces easily to customize this solution. Here is a list I can think of:

1. Change the folder where you can to store the image files
   Easy. Change the variable `my/screenshot-directory` directory, or using `setq`. 
   
2. Change the filename
   A bit more involved, but still easy enough. This part of the code generates the file name based on the current time -- yyyy-mm-ddThhmmss. You can change this part to customize the template filename.

```
       (setq filename (concat my/screenshot-directory
                           (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S")
```

3. Open Snipping Tool to grab a screen shot when you call the command
   You can enable this feature by uncommenting the following part of the code. It then let PowerShell call Snipping Tool, returns the control back to you for you to capture a region of screen, and puts the resultant image into the clipboard. It works good, too, if you prefer this sequence of operations. 

```
    ;;(shell-command "snippingtool /clip") <<< Uncomment this line if you wish
```

4. Improve the PowerShell script
   I can't do it, but if you know how to do it, probably you could do all sorts of good things with it. 
   
   One thing: In the main function, `powershell` appears twice in a row. It is not redundant. I have no idea why, but it needs to be there twice. I tried to make it do with only one, but the image was not correctly stored. I would appreciate it if someone with more knowledge can enlighten me with the way PowerShell works.

### A bit of caution

This solution works, but it is not necessarily designed to handle errors well. I have never had a bag error, but what would happen if the PowerShell script does not work as intended? -- so far, I only have had an empty png file saved. It can be easily checked by opening the link. Just be mindful of the fact that the solution is not intended to be robust when an error occurs, though I do not believe it would cause any grave issues in your system should it error. 

Oh there is a small added bonus: you can use this solution from within the terminal version of Emacs (like I have done for the image file of this article within PowerShell -- yes, I am writing it in Emacs launched within Powershell). This is possible because it delegates handling of images to PowerShell. Emacs does not need to be able to open an image (it is all data and text link in the end).
