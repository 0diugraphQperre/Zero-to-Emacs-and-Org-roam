## Improve quality-of-life with your font, theme, and minimal select packages 

You have got Org-roam going, so you should be good to roam around. That is technically speaking. There is a whole universe of Emacs packages and hacks out there. Let me introduce minimum surviving kit to make your Emacs life better. 

My selection is purely subjective, and aimed at long-form writing as opposed to programming. Here is my selection:

- Font
- Theme
- Ivy
- Olivetti
- Small aesthetic changes

## Set your font

Try setting your default font by `Options > Set Default Fonts`. 
![0590f7903aebf9f6773662bb8f130b09.png](images\0590f7903aebf9f6773662bb8f130b09.png)

You can choose any fonts installed in your system.

… Now it's all good… until you quit Emacs. This is not a permanent configuration.

Try this.
```
;; Font
;; If you want to know how to correct specify a font in Windows,
;; invoke `eval-last-sexp' for (w32-select-font)
(set-face-attribute 'default nil  :font "iA Writer Quattro S-12")
```

`M-x eval-last-sexp` is to evaluate a minimum Emacs program just before your cursor; in this case, `(32-select-font)` is a function (a minimum unit of Elisp program in this context). You cannot use this with `M-x`; hence, we use `eval-last-sexp` instead. 


### Set your theme

Get a theme of your choice, for instance from the list of packages we saw when we got Org-roam. I like Modus-Operandi (light theme) and Modus-Vivendi (dark theme) created by [Prot](https://protesilaos.com/)[^3]. 

In the list, you may find these themes twice: one from MELPA, and the other from GNU. Choose either one. I believe it's just different archive providing the same theme – in fact, if you download one, the other dis appears from the list.

[^3]: Checkout his YouTube tutorials for Emacs; very informative. I really like his no-nonsense style. His dotemacs is also very good study material. 

Put the following part in your `.emacs`, and invoke `M-x eval-buffer`.

```
;; Set theme
;; (Optional) Setting `custom-safe-themes' to t.
;; This prevents Emacs from asking if it is safe to load the theme.
(setq custom-safe-themes t)

;; Automatically load the theme you like
;; I am using Modus Operandi (light theme) here
;; There is also modus-vivendi (dark theme)
(load-theme 'modus-operandi)
```

### Set Ivy mode

An alternative way to install a package is to invoke `M-x pacakge-install`, and then type the package you want, for example, `ivy`, then `RET` (that is, to press <kbd>Enter</kbd>).

Install `swiper` and `counsel` as well as `ivy`; they work together to improve default search and file navigation functions.

Once Ivy is installed, put the following config, and then `M-x eval-buffer` again.

```
;; Ivy,Counsel, & Swiper
;; Enable Ivy mode in general
(ivy-mode 1)
(setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t)
(setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t)

;; Add Counsel and Swiper search functions
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c f r") #'counsel-recentf)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-s") #'swiper)

;; Reple default "M-x" and "C-x C-f" with Counsel version
(global-set-key (kbd "M-x") #'counsel-M-x)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-f") #'counsel-find-file)

;; Optionally, you can replace these default functions with Counsel enhanced ones
;;(global-set-key (kbd "C-h f") 'counsel-describe-function)
;;(global-set-key (kbd "C-h v") 'counsel-describe-variable)

```

I sugget you to try all the functions added here. But one thing to note here is that Org-roam related search functions are **autoamtically** improved by Ivy. For example, try `C-x n /` to find Org-files. See this in action.

Also see the enhanced `M-x`.

### Set Olivetti

Ivy and its companions were for function improvements. Olivetty is more for UX improvement for writing and reading in Emacs. Install it in the same way, like `package-install RET olivetty RET` – notice that Ivy is also enabled here for searching packages.

Put the following in, and invoke `M-x eval-buffer`.

```
;; Olivetti
;; Look & Feel for long-form writing

;; Set the body text width
(setq olivetti-body-width 80)

;; Enable Olivetti for text-related mode such as Org Mode
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'olivetti-mode)
```

Open your long-form Org note, like this one.
![72fe82203e78eb286511ff83ce51efe7.png](images/72fe82203e78eb286511ff83ce51efe7.png)

Notice that you have very generous margins for both sides in the main body – you set width by the variable, `olivetti-body-width`. The texts are also wrapped on the right. They are "visually" wrapped. You can see the difference Olivetti makes by turning it off with `M-x olivetti-mode`. 

Notice that each paragraph continues onto the invisible end to the right. 
![c470f0fa0fd04581de76eba8bdbaa44c.png](images\c470f0fa0fd04581de76eba8bdbaa44c.png)

You can manually turn on the visual line wrapping with `Option > Word Wrap (Visual Line mode)`. Olivetti turns Visual Line mode  for you and add the margins to make writing and reading long text more comfortable. To me, it's a simple and beautiful solution for readability.

### Add small aesthetic changes

Lastly, throw in some aesthetic changes. Especially, the vertical scroll bar between the main body and the Org-roam side pane, to me, is a little too prominant.  

I like the way Elegant Emacs by Nicolas Rougier (rougier on GitHub) deals with these changes in a compact package. Below, I have liberarly copied from his code. 

Put the follow in `.emacs`, and invoke `M-x eval-buffer`.

```
;; Optional aditional aesthetic changes
;; Adapted from `sanity.el' in Elegant Emacs by Nicolas P. Rougier (rougier)
;; https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs

(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
(setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
(setq initial-scratch-message nil)
(setq initial-major-mode 'org-mode)
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
(setq pop-up-windows nil)
(tool-bar-mode 0) 
(tooltip-mode  0)
(scroll-bar-mode 0)
(menu-bar-mode 1) ;menu bar is explictly turned on for beginners. Change the value to 0.

;; Optional aditional aesthetic changes
;; Adapted from `elegance.el' in Elegant Emacs by Nicolas P. Rougier (rougier)
;; https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs

;; Line cursor and no blink
(set-default 'cursor-type  '(bar . 1))
(blink-cursor-mode 0)

;; Line spacing, can be 0 for code and 1 or 2 for text
(setq-default line-spacing 0)

;; Underline line at descent position, not baseline position
(setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
```

The end results
