## Automatic installation script

I have added a script that automates installation of packages that I describe in this guide up to [Chapter 6 on ORB](./60.Org-ref_ORB.md).

Get the contents of folder named [automatic-installation](https://github.com/nobiot/Zero-to-Emacs-and-Org-roam/tree/master/automatic-installation). Put both `install-org-roam.el` and `.emacs.d` folder in your `home` folder. The folder contains only one file `init.el`.

In PowerShell, from your home folder, call this:
    
```emacs-lisp
emacs -l .\install-org-roam.el --batch
```

The script is written in Elisp so you need to have installed Emacs. That's it. It will do some checks for you -- e.g. if Emacs recognises SQLite -- to make sure you can smoothly start using Emacs with Org-roam and ORB. If the script asks yes/no question type "y" or "n" and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The script does not do anything special; it just automates the configuration described in this guide. 

Let me know how you go.
